# TrashER
An app that uses Neural Networks to classify trash. It also helps find recyclers near you.

The app uses a Convultional Neural Network to Classify Waste into Recyclable, Compostable, Trash and E-waste. 
I wrote the CNN myself and achieved a 90% accuracy on test data. Further, the weights were quantised to make the graph 16MB as oppsosed to 
a full Inception Graph that was 85 MB.
